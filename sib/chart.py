"""The front-page figure: lexindex against the smallest trie, on every corpus of the set.

    sib chart results/frontier-1m-<date>-<host>-<commit>.json

Reads one campaign artifact written by `harness/tables.py` and draws the comparison the README
makes in prose: for each corpus, the smallest index lexindex builds against the smallest structure
anyone else in the campaign built. Writes an SVG into `figures/`, named after the artifact's own
commit, so a figure anywhere can always be traced to the run behind it.

Three choices the figure makes, each of which could be made dishonestly:

* **Both sides at their best, which is the only symmetry available.** The other side is the best of
  eight structures, each at the configuration that suits that corpus -- MARISA at the best of the
  one to three tries C² builds, XCDAT at its best of four, CoCo and PDT as the C² benchmark builds
  them. MARISA's smallest lies outside that grid; `sib marisa-floor` measures it, and the README
  sets it beside lexindex. Holding this side to one index while the other picks from eight is not
  modesty, it is a different measurement. So the bar is whichever index lexindex builds smallest,
  and the label says which one it is: `DictIndex` at its block on twelve corpora, `StringIndex` on
  `numeric`, where an fst folds a dense decimal id space into 301 bytes and the label prints that
  rather than a rounded 0.00.
* **The pick is the planner's, not the author's.** `lexindex plan` chooses the index off the keys
  alone, and choosing after seeing the answer would be the mirage this repository exists to refuse.
  Scored against the built blob on 19 corpora, its ranking of the two candidates a memory
  objective picks between is right on every one -- so the bar is what a caller gets without
  reading this figure.
* **A linear axis.** The corpora span a fraction of a byte to 21 bytes a key and a log axis would
  flatter the ratios; the numbers are printed on the bars instead.

`ART` and `C-ART` are excluded, as everywhere else: they count their nodes and not the keys those
nodes point into, so they are not comparable on size.
